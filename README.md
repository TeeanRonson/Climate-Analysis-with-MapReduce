# Climate Analysis with Map Reduce on US Weather Data

**Project Goal:** Analyzing US Weather data to make inferences and inform direction on a series of questions.

**Deliverables:**

1. Code for MapReduce jobs
2. A project report

**Background: USCRN**

The vision of the USCRN program is to maintain a sustainable high-quality climate observation network that 50 years from now can with the highest degree of confidence answer the question:

> *How has the climate of the Nation changed over the past 50 years?*

**Dataset:**

The dataset is collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) *surface reference network* (USCRN). The network is composed of around 150 weather stations based in the USA and is tasked with determining how the US climate has changed (and is changing) over time.

Some background on the data collected:

1. Three independent measurements of temperature and precipitation are made at each station, insuring continuity of record and maintenance of well-calibrated and highly accurate observations.
2. The stations are placed in pristine environments expected to be free of development for many decades. Stations are monitored and maintained to high standards and are calibrated on an annual basis.
3. In addition to temperature and precipitation, these stations also measure solar radiation, surface skin temperature, and surface winds.
4. They also include triplicate measurements of soil moisture and soil temperature at five depths, as well as atmospheric relative humidity for most of the 114 contiguous U.S. stations.

**Notes on the report:**

All of the questions are answered with **context**. Given a question, we embed maps and provide some statistics about it (population, nearby landmarks). Pictures and maps are a good thing. if the question involves some obscure concept; in that case, a link to the appropriate Wikipedia article is presented. Combining different forms of media through *data fusion* can tell a compelling story.
